\usage{
ifeatures(x, chunkSize = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.table containing a key and measures}

\item{chunkSize}{number of measures to include along with}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to \code{ihasNext}

A feature is defined as a measurement associated with a particular entity.
The entities are defined by the key columns.  The measurements are non-key
columns.

nextElem iterates over the measurement (non-key) column and provides a
data.table with the keys of x and one measurement.

The idea is that the measurements can be independently operated on.}
